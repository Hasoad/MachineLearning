1. Your survival chance in Titanic tragedy using R. Using logistic regression, R is to answer if you are going to survive with other survivals according to your age, sex,name and social status (1st to 3rd class).

2. Using Decision Tree algorith, plotted the survial based on  sex, age, embarked,splsp,parch
